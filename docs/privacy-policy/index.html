    <h1>Privacy Policy for PureSticker</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: May 24, 2024</p>

    <p><strong>PureSticker</strong> ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our mobile application (the "App") collects, uses, and safeguards your information.</p>

    <p>By using the App, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p><strong>PureSticker works primarily offline.</strong> We do not collect, store, or transmit your personal data to our own servers. All sticker packs, images, and metadata created within the App are stored locally on your device.</p>

    <h3>a. User-Generated Content</h3>
    <p>The App allows you to create sticker packs using images and videos from your device. This content is stored in your device's local database using Android's Room library. We do not have access to your photos or created stickers.</p>

    <h3>b. Personal Information (Metadata)</h3>
    <p>When creating a sticker pack, you may optionally provide an email address, website, or author name. This information is saved strictly as metadata within the sticker pack file structure on your device. It is required by the WhatsApp Sticker format to attribute authorship but is <strong>not</strong> collected, analyzed, or sent to us.</p>

    <h2>2. Permissions and Device Access</h2>
    <p>To function correctly, the App requests the following permissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Read Storage (Images/Video):</strong> Required to allow you to select photos and videos from your gallery to convert them into stickers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Note: We verify WhatsApp installation using specific package queries defined in the app manifest, respecting user privacy by avoiding broad package visibility permissions.</em></p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services and Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell or share your data with third parties. Data is only shared in the following specific scenario initiated by you:</p>

    <h3>a. WhatsApp</h3>
    <p>When you choose to "Add to WhatsApp," the App exports the selected sticker pack data (images and metadata) directly to the WhatsApp application installed on your device via Android's Content Provider mechanism. This interaction is governed by WhatsApp's own privacy policy.</p>

    <h3>b. Google ML Kit</h3>
    <p>We use <strong>Google ML Kit</strong> for on-device machine learning to assist with image processing (e.g., removing backgrounds from selfies). Processing happens locally on your device, and no image data is sent to Google servers for this purpose.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is intended for general audiences. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. Since the App functions offline and does not require account creation, we hold no personal data of any user, regardless of age.</p>

    <h2>5. Security</h2>
    <p>We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us at:</p>
